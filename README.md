# CS2MapCompilerCPU
 Compile CS2 maps with your cpu if you don't have a gpu with ray tracing support.

# (WARNING) 25.01.2025
Since the last update valve removed the support completely, I am working on a solution.

# Requirements
- CS2 and Workshop Tools installed. (If the application cannot find CS2, click custom path and select cs2.exe)
 
# Usage

I think it's pretty self explanatory.

1. Open your .vmap file
2. Select the desired options.
3. Click compile.
